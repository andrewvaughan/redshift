# Redshift Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Planning, design, development, and support require teamwork and collaboration in order to be successful.  Disagreement
and constructive criticism are a natural element of the development lifecycle, and are to be welcomed by all. Within
that, all contributors - both staff and volunteers - are held accountable to this Code of Conduct in each interaction
made with this project.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Providing criticism in a [constructive manner][yes-and]
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Speaking in a degrading manner of others, regardless of intent
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.  These actions can
be performed with or without notice, with or without recourse, and with or without a right to retribution by the
offending party or parties, at the sole discretion of the project maintainers.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event, or interacting on a private or public forum in representation of the project. Representation of a project may
be further defined and clarified by project maintainers through other documentation or on a case-by-case basis.

All contributors are held accountable to this scope, regardless of context. Within this accountability is an
expectation of all members to uphold and advocate this Code of Conduct in each scenario. This Code of Conduct very
much applies in all interactions with the community, including in times when breaches of the Code of Conduct are in
effect.

*Explicitly,* there is never a valid reason to breach the Code of Conduct, including responding or retaliating to
anyone who has made an offense toward you or others. It is expected that all members of this project who witness a
breach of the Code of Conduct follow the instructions in the [Enforcement](#enforcement) section of this document as
soon as the breach is identified.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team
[via email][email] or by contacting an administrator on the public [Discord server][discord-help].  Administrators
can be identified by a red username or by locating them in the **Administrators** group within the members section.

Administrators can be contacted for breaches in the Code of Conduct at any time, whether online or offline. Reports
should be made privately to an administrator or administrators.  Non-administrative parties, public rooms, group
emails, mailing lists, and other areas of public discussion **must** be explicitly avoided when making or discussing
an ongoing complaint or any prior complaints.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and
appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the
reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
